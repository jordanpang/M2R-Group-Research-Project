title="Fractal Image Compression with Quadtrees",
bookTitle="Fractal Image Compression: Theory and Application",
year="1995",
publisher="Springer New York",
address="New York, NY",
pages="55--77",
abstract="This chapter describes a quadtree-based fractal encoding scheme. The scheme is an extension of the one presented in [45] and is similar to that discussed in [26], [27], and in Chapters 7, 8, and 9. While the results are not optimal, this scheme serves as a reference point for other fractal schemes. It is also a ``typical'' fractal scheme and a good first step for those wishing to implement their own. The code used to generate the results presented in this chapter is given in Appendix A, along with a detailed explanation of its inner workings.",
